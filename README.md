[Optimizing Transportation Costs Using Dijkstra's Algorithm]

/About Us/ - 
We are Group 9, students from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH), 
undertaking a project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course under the guidance of Mr. Đặng Ngọc Hoàng Thành.

/Project Overview/ - 
Transportation efficiency is a critical factor in logistics and supply chain management.
Recognizing this, our project focuses on leveraging Dijkstra's Algorithm, a powerful tool for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs, to optimize transportation costs.
By creating a user-friendly WinForm application, we aim to provide practical insights and solutions for cost-effective route planning.

/Acknowledgments/ - 
We sincerely thank Mr. Đặng Ngọc Hoàng Thành for giving us the opportunity to explore this fascinating topic. 
His support and encouragement have been instrumental in motivating us to push our boundaries and develop a meaningful project.
